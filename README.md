# F.A.Q

## Q: **My Custom Font isn't showing up**

## A: Sadly, the html-to-image library I'm using doesn't work with fonts that aren't part of the actual page, so you have to options:

1. **Take a screenshot yourself.** - Toggling the "Self Capture Mode" checkbox will remove the margins and allow you to manually screenshot the image. Then you can use an image editor of your choice to paste the sceenshot in and save it to whatever format you desire.
2. **Add the font to the site.** - File a new [font request](https://github.com/EddieDover/notecrafter/issues/new?labels=bug&template=font_request.md) or (evem better) a PR and I'll try to add it to the site as soon as possible.
